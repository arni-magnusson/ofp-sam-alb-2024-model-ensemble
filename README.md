## Uncertainty

The SPALB 2024 assessment uncertainty was estimated using a Monte Carlo model ensemble approach in which 100 models incorporated uncertainty in average natural mortality, stock-recruitment steepness and
estimation error for individual models:

## Model ensemble results

The [alb-2024-model-ensemble-results.zip](https://github.com/PacificCommunity/ofp-sam-alb-2024-model-ensemble/releases/download/alb-2024-model-ensemble-results.zip/alb-2024-model-ensemble-results.zip) file contains all files necessary to run or browse the SPALB 2024 model ensemble.

The ensemble models are run from a par file, as described in the corresponding `doitall.sh` script.

The final par and rep files are consistently named `09.par` and `plot-09.par.rep` to facilitate harvesting results from across the 100 ensemble models.

## Estimating uncertainty

See also Section 8, Section 10.6 and Table 9 in the SPALB 2024 stock assessment [report](https://meetings.wcpfc.int/node/23119).

The script requires the FLR and FLR4MFCL packages:
```
install_github("flr/FLCore")
install_github("PacificCommunity/FLR4MFCL")
```
